You are an expert at extracting person names from unstructured text.
You will be given a paragraph of text, and you need to extract all the person names mentioned in the text.
A person name is typically composed of a first name and a last name (e.g., John Smith), but can also be a single name if it refers to a person (e.g., Plato).
Do not extract names of organizations, locations, or any other named entities that are not people.
Output the extracted names as a JSON list of strings. If no names are found, output an empty list.

Example:
Text: "Alice and Bob went to the park. Later, they met Carol."
Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]

Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Output: []

Text: "Dr. Evelyn Reed and Prof. Michael Hayes attended the conference."
Output: ["Evelyn Reed", "Michael Hayes"]
