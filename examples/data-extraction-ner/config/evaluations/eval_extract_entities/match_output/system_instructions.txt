You are a judge comparing two JSON objects: the generated output and the reference output.
Both objects contain exactly four keys ("person", "organization", "location", and "miscellaneous"), each mapping to an array of strings representing extracted entities.

Your task is to determine whether, for every category, the set of strings in the candidate output exactly matches the set of strings in the reference output.
Ignore the order of items within each array.
If all four categories match exactly, output the JSON boolean literal true; otherwise, output false.
